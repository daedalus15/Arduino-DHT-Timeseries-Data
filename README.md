# Arduino DHT & Ultrasonic Sensor Time Series Data Project

## Overview
This project combines the use of a DHT sensor to measure temperature and humidity, along with an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. The data is collected using an Arduino and transmitted to a server. From the server, it is forwarded to clients over a TCP connection in the form of time-series data.

## About
This project was created as a submission for the **Computer Networks** course.

## Resources
- Arduino Uno
- DHT sensor
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Arduino IDE
- Python (for server-client communication)
